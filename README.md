# ThreateningYeti [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/l27pfn6pfyf07b0v?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sup3rvis0r/threateningyeti)

[Download the latest version here](https://github.com/melotic/ThreateningYeti/releases)

ThreateningYeti is a bypass designed for Respondus LockDown Browser. It consists of two projects, the injected DLL (ThreateningYeti) and the DLL Injector (YetiLoader).

ThreateningYeti will hook many WinAPI functions and LockDown Browser's own functions to remove the restrictions of the browser. YetiLoader creates the LockDown Browser process and injects the DLL automatically.

## Features
- Alt-tab during tests
- Disabled covering windows
- Enabled F1-F12 keys, as well as media keys and windows key
- Clipboard is not cleared
- Taskmanager (as well as auto run) is enabled
- LockDown Browser losing focus wont cause it to exit
